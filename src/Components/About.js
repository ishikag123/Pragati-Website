        It was 1990 , on the West Bank of River Hooghly, the famous Industrial
        area , named Liluah , where , few lively , spontaneous young people ,
        who were just in their teens , formed PRAGATI(A GROUP THEATRE) out of
        their inmense love and passionate jeal for theatre and since then
        afterwards the journey continues , holding the hand of theatre and
        passion begins to grow with their growing of age.

        We have participated many theatre festival with our production and
        simultaneously we are organising Theatre Festival almost every year in
        our locality, since 1995.This festival is gaining gentility with the
        vicinity of other many group which are know and even not known to us and
        also many ingenious personality. But our ultimate motto is not to stage
        new production only ,but to grow that love and passion for theatre among
        new generation which we had and still have.We want to train them , to
        make them self sufficient and to make our dream true we have started
        Theatre training workshop recently . We hope that the passion and love
        we are carrying within us for last 32 years , will be induced in them ,
        with our effort and then will see “ Fame in the mirror of Futurity.”
